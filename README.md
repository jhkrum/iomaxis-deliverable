# iomaxis-deliverable

To install dependencies ensure that you have run `npm i` in the directory `/iomaxis-deliverable/` before running the programs.

## client.js

To use `client.js` correctly, use the following syntax:
```
node ./src/client.js file ip port
```

In the case that you do not provide a `port` and `ip` for the program, it will default to `localhost:5000`.

## server.js

To use `server.js` correctly, use the following syntax:
```
node ./src/server.js ip port
```

In the case that you do not provide a `port` and `ip` for the program, it will default to `localhost:5000`.
